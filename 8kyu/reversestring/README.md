Having been provided with the solution function with a string parameter. I understood the first step would be to target and return the str argument with methods to apply this change. the ('split() method') method returns an array of the input. I am then using the ('reverse() method') to reverse the order of the index in the array. Finally the last step would be to return the array back a string using the ('join() method).
