Break camelCase
In order to go about solving this code I understood that each character in the string passed in would need to be accounted for. That being, str.split turns the sting into an array where I then set a loop and an if condition to check for a string the same index with an upperCase letter. I then splice the space within the string to then return: the join method to return the new string with a space between the words.
