In order to check and make sure the string passed in contains all the letters of the alphabet. I put the entire alphabet into a string and store this into a variable called alphabet so that I can then use a for loop to read through the string passed into the application involves all but using this condition to check for a value of -1. which in this case would represent this not being satisfied. considering arrays begin counting at 0, using -1 takes account of the 26 letters.
